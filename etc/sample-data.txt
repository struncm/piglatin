As any developer can tell you deploying any code carries technical risk. Software might crash or bugs might emerge. 
Deploying features carries ad'ditional user-related risk. Users might hate the new features or run into account management issues. 
With traditional deployments all of this risk is absorbed at once.

Feature flags give developers the ability to SeParate these risks dea'ling with one at a time. They can put the new code into production 
see how that goes and THen turn on the feaTures later once it's clear the code is working as expected.
